# RoadColors

This repo is a fork from https://github.com/erdavis1/RoadColors

Here you can find some test with worldwide version of the program. 

From its readme:

Worldwide:
Plot roads in any worldwide city using OpenStreetMap data. It derives road designations from the road name. I only wrote this to work for countries that use English or Romance languages--it doesn't work for languages like German (which mashes the road designation into the road name with no spaces) or languages that don't use the Latin alphabet.

You can find open street maps to download here: http://download.geofabrik.de/

Extract the files in a folder and set the path into the R script.

In order to play the script you will need the R language (here the Windows version https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/ ) and R Studio (download it here https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ )
